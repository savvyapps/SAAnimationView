 SAAnimationView is a class that helps create very dynamic animations. It uses @c CADisplayLink
 to create a runloop and update itself every frame. The animation is performed by utilizing 
 the progress property to manually set the state of the animation, this can be done by setting
 the frame/transform of a subview, using the @c drawRect: method to draw custom content, or by
 setting any other property that would modify the way the view is rendered

/**
 This method is a helper to divide an animation into different "slices". Given a sliceOffset and
 a sliceDuration, this method will return a value of where the progress is within that slice, note
 that the return value might be outside that slice.
 
 For example, if you want to divide your animation into three slices or sub-animations, each slice
 would have a duration of 0.33; the first slice would have an offset of 0, the second would have 0.33, and
 the third one would have 0.66.
 
 If you want to normalize the total progress in the second slice, you would do
 @c normalize(progress,0.33,0.33) when progress is between 0.33 and 0.66, this will normalize the
 progress and give you a number between 0 and 1, which is a lot easier to use.
 If you use this with a progress lower than 0.33 you'll get a number lower than 0, if you use it with a
 progress greater than 0.66 you'll get a number greater than 1

 Example code:
 @code
 if(self.progress < .33){
   CGFloat normalP = normalizeSlice(self.progress, 0.00, .33);
   // Draw first step with normalP in [0,1]
 }else if(self.progress < .66){
   CGFloat normalP = normalizeSlice(self.progress, 0.33, .33);
   //	Draw second step with normalP in [0,1]
 }else{
   CGFloat normalP = normalizeSlice(self.progress, 0.66, .33);
   //	Draw third step with normalP in [0,1]
 }
 @endcode
 
 @param progress The current progress to normalize
 @param sliceOffset Where the slice will start. Has to be in the @c[0,1] range
 @param sliceDuration Duration of slice
